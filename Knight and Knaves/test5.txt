One evening as you are out for a stroll, you walk by a doorway labeled no normalsallowed.  Some people are talking inside.  Curious, you listen, and you hear SirPaul who says:  "Sir James and Sir A is Knight." As for Sir John, who is also inside, he just keeps quiet.  Who is aKnight, and who is a Knave? Sir James says: "All of us are Knaves".
